Program compiled and tested many times with g++ 4.8.4.(cse312 virtual machine)
I did not take any error when program is running or compiling.

about test.cpp:
    I wrote test.cpp for testing all instructions that required. First,
    program asks how many Hex object will be created. Then shows all options
    that my program can do. (for exit enter -1)
save load file command:
    while playing game, you can save or load game.
    for load from file LOAD file.txt
    for save to file SAVE file.txt
quit command(new):
    while playing game, you can quit from into the game(write quit when object's
    function waiting for location for the cell).And you can continue playing where 
    you left off without deleting the object.
